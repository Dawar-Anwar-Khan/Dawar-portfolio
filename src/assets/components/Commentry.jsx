          <b>"Drawn to the invisible architecture behind the digital world",</b>
          &nbsp; My journey into technology began not with formal instruction,
          but with a quiet fascination. It started when I was just a kid, 
          breaking things on purpose, just to figure out how to put them back
          together. I stumbled into code like a secret language, and suddenly
          the screen wasn’t just a screen it was a canvas. Since then, I’ve
          built things that work, broken things that didn’t, and stayed up
          chasing that one bug at 2 a.m. Every project I touch teaches me
          something new about logic, about design, about myself. I don’t just
          write code to ship features. I write to shape experience. And
          somewhere between structure and intuition, I’ve found the space where
          I do my best work.
